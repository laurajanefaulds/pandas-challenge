    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the average grades, passing rates, budget, sizes and types of the fifteen high schools comprising the PyCity school district has given us the following results:\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, schools throughout the district all show slightly higher scores in reading (81%) than in math (78%), with a passing rate of 74% in math and 81% in reading, indicating that there is a greater range in unique math scores among students. The average overall passing rate for both subjects is 65%, showing us that there is some disparity between student success rates in either subject, and that high reading scores do not necessarily equal high math scores, and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "The PyCity school district is composed of two types of schools, district and charter. Examining the data further, it becomes clear that PyCity’s charter schools are experiencing significantly greater success in overall passing rates than the district schools, with at least 89% of all charter school students passing both math and reading. District schools, meanwhile, are looking at a 53-54% overall pass rate across all schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "Individual math and reading scores in district schools are also significantly lower than they are in charter schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across both district and charter schools, math and reading scores remain consistent across all grades, with no significant peaks or valleys. \n",
    "\n",
    "Delving deeper into our financial data, we see that the majority of district schools have significantly higher budgets than do the charter schools in PyCity, though they also have uniformly larger numbers of total students. Though our district school students do ultimately receive slightly higher per capita spending than do our charter school students, this does not appear to help their overall success rates. The students in both districts who receive the least funding per capita  experience substantially higher pass rates (90 percent on average) than do the students who receive the most funding per capita, which results in a 53% pass rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more significant variable when assessing overall passing rates is the school size. Schools with student body populations of less than 1000 experience an average overall passing rate of 90\\%, whereas schools with student body populations of 2000-5000 experience an average overall passing rate of 58\\%. All district schools in PyCity fall into the 2000-5000 range, while only one charter school falls into this range, with the majority comprised of 2000 students or less. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, it appears that student body size has a greater bearing on student success rates than does the per capita budget. Our analysis makes clear that, when it comes to student success, money simply does not go as far as one-on-one attention.  \n"
